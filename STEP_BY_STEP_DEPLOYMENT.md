# üöÄ Step-by-Step GoDaddy Deployment Guide
*Your First Website Deployment Made Simple*

## üìã **BEFORE WE START - CHECKLIST**

Make sure you have:
- [ ] GoDaddy hosting account active
- [ ] Domain yorkville.global pointing to your hosting
- [ ] Access to GoDaddy hosting control panel
- [ ] This project code on your computer

---

## üîß **STEP 1: BUILD YOUR WEBSITE**

### **On Your Computer:**

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt** in your project folder
2. **Install dependencies** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Create the production build**:
   ```bash
   npm run build:production
   ```
4. **Wait for build to complete** - you'll see a `dist` folder created

### **What Just Happened?**
- Your React code was converted to regular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- All files were optimized and compressed for fast loading
- Everything is now ready for a web server

## üåê **STEP 2: ACCESS YOUR GODADDY HOSTING**

### **Log Into GoDaddy:**

1. **Go to** [godaddy.com](https://godaddy.com)
2. **Click "Sign In"** (top right)
3. **Enter your GoDaddy username and password**
4. **Go to "My Products"**
5. **Find "Web Hosting"** and click **"Manage"**

### **Open File Manager:**

1. **Look for "File Manager"** or **"cPanel"**
2. **Click to open it**
3. **You should see folders** like `public_html`, `logs`, etc.

---

## üìÅ **STEP 3: PREPARE YOUR HOSTING FOLDER**

### **Clean Out Default Files:**

1. **Navigate to `public_html` folder** (this is where your website lives)
2. **Delete any existing files** (like default GoDaddy pages)
   - Look for files like `index.html`, `coming-soon.html`, etc.
   - **Select all** and **delete them**

### **Why We Do This:**
- `public_html` is the "root" of your website
- When someone visits yorkville.global, they see what's in this folder
- We need it empty to upload your new website

---

## üì§ **STEP 4: UPLOAD YOUR WEBSITE FILES**

### **Upload the Website Content:**

1. **In File Manager, make sure you're in `public_html`**
2. **Look for "Upload" button** (usually at the top)
3. **Navigate to your project folder on your computer**
4. **Go into the `dist` folder** (created in Step 1)
5. **Select ALL files inside the `dist` folder**:
   - `index.html`
   - `assets` folder
   - `robots.txt`
   - `sitemap.xml`
   - `site.webmanifest`
   - Any other files in `dist`
6. **Upload all these files**

### **Upload the .htaccess File:**

1. **Still in `public_html` folder**
2. **Upload the `.htaccess` file** from your project root
3. **Important:** This file might be hidden - make sure it uploads

### **What Your Folder Should Look Like:**
```
public_html/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index-[hash].js
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index-[hash].css
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [other asset files]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ robots.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sitemap.xml
